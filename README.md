# Text-Interpreter

This program takes input from the console and prints out the entered message. It uses the PIL and imageio Python libraries in order to do so

All of the code was written by me in Python 2.7 using the PIL and ImageIO libraries.

The alphabet.py contains all the methods for drawing each letter (uppercase and lowercase) and some symbols (those are still under development)

The alphabetTester.py makes an image of all the letters when run

The messageMaker.py when run, asks the user for a font size (amount of pixels for each side of a square of a letter) and a message then saves the image to an output folder.

This project was started 30th of December 2018. I plan to incorporate more symbols and add a text wrapping feature.
